Common sense should tell you to let an airplane that is travelling at triple your speed to go ahead, but air law does not require it."

(An aircraft towing objects does NOT have right of way over another power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft if the latter has declared an emergency, but apparently they didn't think of that exception when they made up this question)."

Tricky question, eh? Get used to it. Transport Canada likes to play word games on their exams."
